# 03-Match-3 - Citrus Splash
A Match-3 project for MSCH-C220 completed on March 5, 2022. The goal of this project was to take a featureless Match-3 game and implement features to make it "juicy", or more enjoyable for the player.

Citrus Splash is a simple Match-3 game where the player matches assorted citrus fruits for a minute straight, attempting to make as many matches as possible in order to collect ice cubes for an icy, refreshing drink.

## Implementation
Shaders, 
Add sound effects, 
Add music, 
Add a background to the game, 
Animate the elements when they are selected, 
Pieces turn into ice cubes when matched,
